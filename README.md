# QBob Manual

This is the official documentation for the 1997 game QBob by MoonRock Software, Inc. The documentation provided with the game (qbob.hlp) no longer works in the latest versions of Windows. This version is completely redone in HTML and will work in all browsers.

[View the manual here](https://projectsoffun.github.io/QBob-Manual/)

The final build of the manual is in the /docs directory. All the other files are dev files and can be ignored unless you want to know how the sausage is made.

## Now that you've read the manual, buy the game!

We are still selling QBob on our Web site. Download the shareware version and purchase a registration code here: http://www.moonrock.com/qbob

## Now Available: _QBob: Remastered_!

Why not try out the latest version of _QBob_, now [available on Steam!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3781720/QBob_Remastered/)

We also have an [New Manual for the New Game](https://projectsoffun.github.io/QBob-Manual/QBob-Remastered-Manual.pdf)!

Thanks!
